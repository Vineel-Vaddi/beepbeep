# 🚦 BEEPBEEP — Traffic Violation Dataset Builder (YouTube → Frames)

BEEPBEEP is a dataset generation tool for building **computer vision traffic violation detection systems**.

It allows you to:

* Download traffic videos from YouTube
* Extract high-quality frames for annotation
* Automatically sample frames based on your dataset goal
* Maintain structured logs for reproducibility

This tool is designed to help build datasets for:

* Helmet detection
* Triple riding detection
* Wrong route detection
* Number plate detection (ANPR)
* Other traffic violations

---

## 🔍 Why this project?

Building AI systems for traffic monitoring requires **large, well-labeled datasets**.
Public datasets are limited and often not suitable for Indian road conditions.

This tool solves that by enabling:

* Easy dataset collection from real traffic videos
* Smart frame sampling (no duplicate frames)
* Reproducible experiment tracking
* Clean dataset structure for YOLO / Detectron / MMDetection pipelines

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Download videos from YouTube
✅ Extract frames automatically
✅ Bulk processing via CSV
✅ Smart sampling based on FPS and dataset goal
✅ Supports local video files
✅ Per-video output folders
✅ CSV + JSON run logs
✅ Annotation-ready output

## ⚙️ Installation

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U yt-dlp opencv-python
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the bulk tool

```bash
python bulk_yt_to_frames.py
```

You will be prompted to choose:

### Step 1 — Input mode

```
1) CSV file with YouTube URLs
2) Single YouTube URL
3) Already downloaded video file/folder
```

### Step 2 — Dataset Goal

```
1) Fast labeling   (~2 fps)
2) Balanced        (~3 fps)   [Recommended]
3) High detail     (~4 fps)
```

The tool will:

* Download each video
* Detect FPS automatically
* Choose best sampling rate
* Extract frames
* Log the run

---

## 📊 Smart Sampling Logic

| Goal          | Target FPS | Usage                    |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Fast labeling | ~2 fps     | Quick PoC, small dataset |
| Balanced      | ~3 fps     | Best for training        |
| High detail   | ~4 fps     | Fine-grained detection   |

The tool automatically computes:

```
EVERY_N_FRAMES = round(video_fps / target_fps)
```

So a 60 FPS video with Balanced goal:

```
EVERY_N_FRAMES = 60 / 3 = 20
```

---

## 🧾 Logging & Reproducibility

Each run is logged into:

```
logs/runs_log.csv
logs/runs_log.jsonl
```

With fields:

* Date & time
* Input source
* Goal
* YouTube URL
* Video title
* Video path
* Frames folder
* FPS
* Total frames
* Sampling rate
* Extracted frames count
* Status (SUCCESS / FAILED)

This makes experiments **fully traceable and reproducible**.

---

## 🎯 Output

Each video gets its own folder:

```
frames_out/
   videoid_timestamp/
      frame_00000000.jpg
      frame_00000020.jpg
      frame_00000040.jpg
      ...
```

Ready for:

* LabelImg
* CVAT
* Roboflow
* YOLO training pipelines

---

## 🧠 Intended Use

This project is the dataset foundation for building:

* AI Traffic Police Systems
* Helmet Violation Detection
* Triple Riding Detection
* Wrong Route Detection
* Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)

---

## ⚠️ Legal Notice

This tool is for **research and educational purposes only**.
Use only videos you have permission to download and annotate.

Always comply with:

* YouTube terms of service
* Local privacy and surveillance laws

---

## 📌 Next Roadmap

* Annotation format export (YOLO)
* Auto-blur faces & plates
* Violation auto-tagging
* Model training pipeline
* Live camera ingestion
